# sunsets-today
A Twitterbot that laments the setting of the sun.

Key things to build:

- randomly select times to tweet 
- get the time until sunset based on a configurable location
- generate a tweet based on some sort of template/grammar and the amount of time
  until sunset
- tweet it 
- potentially, respond to tweets
